# Script Name: Area_Circle.py
# Author: Mwangi
# Purpose: This script Calculates the area of a circle.
# Usage: For example the expected outcome is :
#
# Circle Area: 12.57 square meters
# Cylinder Surface Area: 150.80 square meters
# Total Area: 163.36 square meters
#
# This program is subsequently used as a module for the program Area_CircleImportTest.py
